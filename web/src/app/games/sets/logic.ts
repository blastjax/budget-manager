/**
 * Sets solving assistant.
 *
 * Sets (the pattern-matching card game) deals cards with 4 features —
 * symbol, color, texture, count — each with 3 possible variants. Three cards
 * form a valid Set when, independently for every feature, the three cards
 * are either all the same or all different; any feature where exactly two
 * cards agree breaks it.
 *
 * This isn't a puzzle the app poses — it's a helper for playing the real
 * game: you enter the cards you see on the table and it finds every valid
 * Set among them, or — given just two cards — the exact third card that
 * would complete one.
