"""
Payslip and installment storage: cloud PostgreSQL (Neon), via ``DATABASE_URL``.

The query layer below is written in SQLite's dialect -- ``?`` placeholders and
all -- because that is what it was when the app ran on a local file. Rather
than rewrite ~2,500 lines of working SQL, ``db_cursor`` hands out a thin
wrapper that translates each statement on its way to psycopg2:

  - ``?`` placeholders become ``%s`` (quote- and comment-aware, so a ``?``
    inside a string literal or a ``--`` comment is left alone)
  - a literal ``%`` is doubled when parameters are present, since psycopg2
    uses ``%`` for its own interpolation

The rest of the dialect already lines up: ``RETURNING``, ``ON CONFLICT ... DO
UPDATE SET ... excluded.x`` and ``NULLS LAST`` are Postgres syntax that SQLite
adopted, and the schema uses no SQLite-only functions.

Values coming back are normalised in ``_row_to_dict`` so callers see exactly
what they saw under SQLite -- JSON-safe primitives:

  - TIMESTAMPTZ(0) / DATE / TIME -> ISO-8601 ``str``
  - NUMERIC                      -> ``float`` (not ``Decimal``)
  - BYTEA                        -> ``bytes`` (not ``memoryview``)

The timestamp columns are ``TIMESTAMPTZ(0)`` -- whole seconds -- so every
rendered value has the same shape. At microsecond precision ``.isoformat()``
drops the fractional part when it happens to be zero, which had one column
emitting both ``...T02:06:38.428777+00:00`` and ``...T08:56:00+00:00``. See
``backend/scripts/normalize_time_types.py``.

That matters beyond tidiness: ``cache.set`` serialises responses with
``json.dumps(..., default=str)``, which renders a ``datetime`` as
``"2026-04-13 02:06:38+00:00"`` while FastAPI renders the same value as
``"2026-04-13T02:06:38+00:00"``. Left alone, a response would change shape
depending on whether it came from Redis or the database. Normalising here
gives one representation everywhere.

The schema itself is owned by ``backend/scripts/migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py``,
not by this module -- ``init_schema()`` only verifies that the expected tables
are present, so there is no second copy of the DDL to drift out of sync.

Round trips
-----------
Neon is remote -- measured from the dev machine, one round trip to the
ap-southeast-1 endpoint costs 35-80 ms depending on the network -- so what
dominates a request is not how much work Postgres does but how many times we
wait for it. A read used to cost *six* round trips, only one of which was the
query::

    SELECT 1 / ROLLBACK liveness probe   3   (BEGIN, SELECT 1, ROLLBACK)
    the query itself                     2   (BEGIN, SELECT ...)
    COMMIT                               1

Two changes below cut that to one:

  - connections are checked out in **autocommit** mode, and
    ``_TranslatingCursor`` flips autocommit off only when it sees the first
    *write* statement of a block. A read therefore issues no BEGIN and no
    COMMIT; a write still gets a real transaction covering every write in the
    block, so multi-statement writes stay atomic.
  - the liveness probe is **idle-gated**. It exists because Neon suspends an
    idle compute and drops its connections, which is only a risk once a
    connection has actually sat idle -- so it runs only when the connection
    has not been used for ``BUDGET_DB_PROBE_AFTER_SECONDS``, and when it does
    run it is a bare ``SELECT 1`` in autocommit: one round trip, not three.
